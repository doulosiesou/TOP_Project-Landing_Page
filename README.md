This project is for The Odin Project, Foundations Course, Project: Landing Page
The basis for design is 2 provided images from TOP that I have located in the ./img folder
    1. The font thatâ€™s being used in the images is roboto.
    2. Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.
The webpage I'm creating has 4 main sections (and a footer),
    1. A header section
    2. A div section that contains an image rectangular in shape, text to the left of the   
       image and a button
    3. Another div section that contains 4 different square images the heading of which is
       'Some Random Information' with text below summarizing the image
    4. A fourth section with a random quote
    5. A footer
